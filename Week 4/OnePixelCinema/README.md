# One Pixel Cinema

## Introduction
This sketch is for the Creative Coding class offered by Monash University
through Future Learn: https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/creative-coding/

The sketch is for the exercise One Pixel Cinema.  I chose to do a sketch
where images are read and random pixels are drawn from the image onto
the sketch's canvas.  The random pixels are actually a random sample
chosen at 5 pixel increments.  This leads to a blurry image.

All images in the data directory will be drawn in sequence.
